# DELA-Eprommer-II-ENG-software-for-Commodore-64
A translated version of the DELA Eprommer II german software for the Commodore 64 EPROM programmer

This is an english translation for the DELA Eprommer II software. 
Dela Eprommer was an EPROM Programmer for Commodore 64. Nowadays you can build your own replica thanks to some smart folks here on github (links below)

In the SOFTWARE folder you will find a ZIP file that contains:

- The .d64 disk image with two version of software: the original and the other is for the 27512 extension. More info about it at the RetroNynjah page (see link below)

- The manuals (roughly translated from German by Google).

- My note with some issues I experienced about  .PRG and  .BIN files and a software to fix them, if you need.
